CSS Eldoc Plugin
====================

*ATTENTION: I have not finished CSS3 properties yet.*

This is css-eldoc, an eldoc-mode plugin for CSS source code.

Eldoc-mode is a MinorMode which shows you, in the echo area, the argument list of the function call you are currently writing. Very handy. By NoahFriedman.
